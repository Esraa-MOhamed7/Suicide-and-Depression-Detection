# 🧠 AI-Powered Suicide Detection (NLP)

This project demonstrates how **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** can be applied to detect suicidal intent in text using a **TF‑IDF + SVM model**.  
It is built with **Streamlit** for an interactive web interface.

---

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to build a reliable text classification model that can distinguish between **suicidal** and **non‑suicidal** expressions.

### Workflow
1. **Importing Libraries** – load essential Python packages for data handling, visualization, and modeling.  
2. **Data Exploration** – examine the dataset, understand its structure, and identify patterns in text and labels.  
3. **Data Analysis** – visualize distributions, text lengths, and frequent words to gain deeper insights.  
4. **Modeling & Evaluation** – train multiple machine learning models (TF‑IDF + LinearSVM, Logistic Regression, etc.), compare their performance, and select the best.  
5. **Save Model** – export the final model for deployment in a web application.
